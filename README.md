## How To Use

### Installation
#### Node
  - #### Node installation on Windows

    Just go on [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/) and download the installer.
    Also, be sure to have `git` available in your PATH, `npm` might need it (You can find git [here](https://git-scm.com/)).

  - #### Node installation on Ubuntu

    You can install nodejs and npm easily with apt install, just run the following commands.

        $ sudo apt install nodejs
        $ sudo apt install npm

  - #### Other Operating Systems
    You can find more information about the installation on the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/) and the [official NPM website](https://npmjs.org/).

  If the installation was successful, you should be able to run the following command.

      $ node --version
      v8.11.3

      $ npm --version
      6.1.0

## Future Plans

   The current site does not contain any account based system for the users so that they can make there own account that may show player career result or the match historyof his/her team.
   This can be done by adding registration/login feautre /google auth.
   
   Make the frontend more beautiful using React.JS and adding more JavaScript that may enhance user's experience.
